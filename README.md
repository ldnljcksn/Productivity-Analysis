# Productivity Analysis
This is a simple application for tracking productivity in terms of mouse and keyboard activity.
Simply run the program from cli.py and follow the prompts. The program will ask you how many
minutes you would like to track and, after the time period has passed, you will be shown a
minute-by-minute analysis of your mouse and keyboard interactions, including a graph.
